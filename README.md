# Clinical Management System 🏥

A full-stack web application developed during an intensive 1-week training program at **Faith InfoTech**, Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram. The system was built by a 9-member team using **Angular**, **Django**, and a **PostgreSQL** backend (initially MySQL). The CMS streamlines hospital workflows like patient registration, staff and doctor management, appointments, prescriptions, and lab tests.

## 💼 My Contribution

I was responsible for developing parts of the **Receptionist Module**, including:

- ✅ **Patient Management**:  
  - List all patients  
  - Add new patients  
  - Delete patient records  

- 🛠 **Membership Management**:  
  - Contributed to foundational setup and UI integration  

This fast-paced project helped sharpen my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and collaborative software engineering under real-time constraints.

## 📌 Notes

- Backend initially used MySQL and was migrated to PostgreSQL for better deployment compatibility.
- RESTful APIs were used for communication between frontend and backend.
- Emphasis on modular codebase and clean UI using SCSS and Angular components.
